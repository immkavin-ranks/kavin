        <h2>About me. . .</h2>
        <p>
          Greetings! I'm Kavin, a passionate and versatile developer with a deep
          love for technology and a knack for solving complex problems. I thrive
          in the dynamic world of software development, and my journey has led
          me to explore a multitude of tech stacks.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          My dedication to continuous learning has allowed me to stay at the
          forefront of the ever-evolving tech landscape. Currently on the path
          to becoming a full-stack developer, I relish the challenges that come
          with bridging the gap between the user interface and the server-side
          logic. My goal is to create seamless, user-centric experiences that
          not only meet but exceed expectations.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          While I'm deeply immersed in the world of coding, there's more to me
          than just lines of code. I'm a fervent believer in the power of
          collaboration and continuous improvement. I enjoy staying connected
          with the tech community, attending conferences, and participating in
          open-source projects.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="sign" id="sign">Best regards,<br />Kavin Manoharan</p>
